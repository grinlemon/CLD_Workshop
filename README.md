# Kubernetes cluster on Infomaniak Public Cloud

## POC objectives

Validate the possible use of the Public Cloud of Infomaniak in the context of a startup which needs to deploy containers on the web using Kubernetes.

## Infra architecture

On the Kubernetes documentation, we can find a cluster architecture diagram which will present how it works.

In our case we want to deploy the content of the CLD lab 5 (Kubernetes on Google Cloud) but on a swiss cloud which is way better concerning data protection and security. As we want a complete control of the cloud plateform we need to use a IaaS and not a CaaS.

## Scenario

Describe step-by-step the scenario. Write it using this format (BDD style).

### STEP 01
```
//given -> starting context

//when -> event to produce

//then - > expected result
```

### STEP 01
```
We are a new startup and we need a way to deploy containers on the web. We want to have a complete control of our cloud plateform.

Book ressources on Infomaniak Public Cloud and get access to their services.

Acces to Infomaniak Public Cloud services.
```

### STEP 02
```
We want to deploy Kubernetes on our public cloud instance.

Use 

//then - > expected result
```
